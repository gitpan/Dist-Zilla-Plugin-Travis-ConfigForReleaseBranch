=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch - Create a .travis.yml suitable for built branches

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.000_01 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch - released August 11, 2013 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Travis-ConfigForReleaseBranch.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ; in your dist.ini
    [Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles> plugin to include a
sensible -- or so this author believes -- C<.travis.yml> suitable for running
L<Travis-CI jobs|http://travis-ci.org> off of a release branch like one
generated by the L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::CommitBuild>
plugin.

By default, we build against Perl 5.8, 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16 and 5.18.
The 5.8 build job is allowed to fail without causing the entire build run
to fail.

=head1 EARLY VERSION!

Yep, this is an early, early version.  No tests, and no flexibility in
configuration details.  Anyone wishing to assist (and faster than this author
in remedying this sad, sad state of affairs) is more than welcome to submit
pull requests.  Good pull requests are likely to earn the undying gratitude of
this humble CPAN author.
